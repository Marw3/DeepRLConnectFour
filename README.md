# Praktikum DeepRL group4

This is a deep reinforcement learning project for the connect-4 environment.

## Task

- Design Connect4 environment
- Train a model using Deep Q-Learning
- Train a decision transformer-based model
- Compare both models


## Notebooks to run

- PlayGame: To play a game dqn against decision transformer etc.
- Evaluation: To evaluate the win rates between the different agents
- DQN/Training: To train the dqn model
- DecisionTransformer/Training: To train the decision transformer

## Agents

- DQN
- Decision Transformer
- NegaMax
- Random
- HumanAgent

## Install
